prometheus:

=> A metric monitoring and alerting tool that collects data through endpoints
=> It is a pull base metric, it needs the location of specific endpoints meaning the server needs to expose its endpoint so Prometheus can get data from that servers 
 for that, you can use  3rd party to expose endpoints
=> It uses promQL language to search and discover data
